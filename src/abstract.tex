Alias analysis is one of the most fundamental techniques that
compilers use to optimize languages with pointers.
However, in spite of all the attention that this topic has received, the current
state-of-the-art approaches inside compilers still face challenges regarding
precision and speed.
In particular, pointer arithmetic, a key feature in C and C++, is yet to be
handled satisfactorily.
This work presents a new alias analysis algorithm to solve this problem.
The key insight of our approach is to combine alias analysis with symbolic
range analysis.
This combination lets us disambiguate fields within arrays and structs,
effectively achieving more precision than traditional algorithms.
To validate our technique, we have implemented it on top of the LLVM compiler.
Tests on a vast suite of benchmarks show that we can disambiguate several
kinds of C idioms that current state-of-the-art analyses cannot deal with.
In particular, we can disambiguate 1.35x more queries than the alias analysis
currently available in LLVM.
Furthermore, our analysis is very fast: we can go over one million assembly
instructions in 10 seconds.
